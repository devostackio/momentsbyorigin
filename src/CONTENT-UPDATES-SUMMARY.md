## Next Steps

To apply all changes, each layout component file needs to be rewritten with the content from `/Website-Copy-All-Layouts-Revised.md`.

Would you like me to:
1. Update all layouts now (will take multiple operations)
2. Update specific layouts one at a time for review
3. Create a batch script to handle all updates

**Recommendation**: Update all layouts in sequence to ensure consistency across the entire presentation.
